Anesthetic records from surgeries are stored as XML files. \\nThese files contain data regarding what events occurred during the surgery, \\nwhat drugs were administered, the dose and time of administration, and \\nmeasurement of physiological parameters such as: blood pressures, heart \\nrates, and the volume of CO2 and anesthetic agent exhaled. \\n<drug> \\n<drname SNOMED=11387423006°>Propofol</drname> \\n<drtime>883</drtime> \\n<drdose> \\n<drvalue>l50</drvalue> \\n<drunit>mg</drunit> \\n</drdose> \\n<drroute>IV</drroute> \\n</drug> \\n<drug> \\n<drname SNOMED=u387470007\">Cephazolin</drname> \\n<drtirne>883</drti.me> \\n<drdose> \\n<drvalue>lOOO</drvalue> \\n<drunit>mg</drunit> \\n</drdose> \\n<drroute>IV</drroute> \\n</drug> \\nFIGURE 3.1: Part of XML file containing data on drug, time, \\nand dose of adininistration. \\nThe programming language \\'R\\' was used to store and manipulate the rele\\xad\\nvant data.

The author enjoyed their time working as a re\\xad\\nsearch assistant. Working as a researcher is challenging but rewarding. It \\ncan be slow, tedious, and require funding. However, discovering some\\xad\\nthing new, creating knowledge, and the ability to investigate and solve a \\nreal world problem are aspects of research that the author found very stim\\xad\\nulating. Furthermore, the formal statistical analysis performed in thls in\\xad\\nvestigation was the first performed by the author. It was fantastic experi\\xad\\nence that the author both excelled at and enjoyed. It has inspired the author \\nto consider applying for postgraduate opportunities, both at the University \\nof Auckland and abroad. \\n4.4 Final Remarks \\nOver the course of this work experience (and previous employment) the \\nauthor identified that a healthy work life balance was important. The au\\xad\\nthor was encouraged to work between 40 and 45 hours a week, with flexible \\nwork hours. This ensured the author was not overworked and was able to \\nengage in a range of leisure activities. This flexibility combined with inspir\\xad\\ning and interesting work made it a pleasure to work with , and \\ntheFMHS.
